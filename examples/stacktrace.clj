;;; hashtag currently provides a mechanism to process and reutnr the stacktrace.
;;; However, unlike local bindings, stacktrace is available at runtime
;;; (vs. compile-time), and so can be grabbed by a custom handler function.
;;; Benefits:
;;; * Removes the only dependency (clj-tacktrace) from hashtag
;;; * Allows handler authors to process stacktraces as required, based
;;; on the environment, other tooling, whatever, rather than forcing
;;; default choices (e.g. dropping the first 3 frames by default.)
;;; * Simplifies extenstion of hashtag to ClojureScript.
